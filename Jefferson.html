               <p style="font-size: large; color: black; font-size: large; line-height: 1.5; text-align: center;"> Jefferson was born to a wealthy slaver and 
                at one time during his life had owned over 600 enslaved people <br>
                as well as fathering a multitude of children from enslaved women. Beyond the Declaration of Independence, <br>
                Jefferson was elected twice for govenor of Virginia and in 1789, accepted an invitation to become the secretary of state <br>
                for George Washington.  Through difference of opinions, he was apart of a political division and became <br>
                 the leader of the Democratic-Republicans in 1796, where he was named president in the same year. </p>
