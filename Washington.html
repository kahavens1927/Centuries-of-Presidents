               <p style="text-align: center; color: black; font-size: large; line-height: 2;"> George Washington was born to slave owners in Virginia and when his father died,
                he became a slave owner and the head of his household at age 11. Because of this, he was
                without a formal education.  His military career started early and was appointed to
                the position of Major at age 21. He married in 1758 and spent the next few decades growing 
                his wealth. In 1787, he started down the path to become president by being elected as a delegate
                to the Constitutional Convention.
