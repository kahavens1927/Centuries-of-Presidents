               Adams spent his early life with a good education and eventually went to Harvard. Early in his political <br>
               career, Adams emerged as the leader of the pro-independence faction in Congress and nominated <br>
               George Washington of Virginia to Commander-in-Cheif. Adams returned home in 1779 <br>
                and authored the Massachusetts state constitution, the longest running state <br>
               constitution in the nation. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died on July 4, 1826.
